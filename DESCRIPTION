Description: This package provides raster layers from which pollution estimates
             can be extracted for latitude longitude coordinates within the
             contiguous United States at a 10km x 10km resolution. The recent
             modified version of the package also allows the user to download
             the pollutant data at the county, MMSA, census tract and zipcode
             level. Data is based on publicly available, pre-generated files
             from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for
             years 1997 to 2021.
