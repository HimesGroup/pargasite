Description: Offers tools to estimate and visualize levels of major pollutants
             (CO, NO2, SO2, Ozone, PM2.5 and PM10) across the conterminous
             United States for user-defined time ranges. Provides functions to
             retrieve pollutant data from the U.S. Environmental Protection
             Agencyâ€™s 'Air Quality System' (AQS) API service
             <https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html> for
             interactive visualization through a 'shiny' application, allowing
             users to explore pollutant levels for a given location over time
             relative to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
