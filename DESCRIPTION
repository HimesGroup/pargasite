Description: 'PARGASITE' (Pollution-Associated Risk Geospatial Analysis Site)
             offers tools to estimate and visualize levels of major pollutants
             (CO, NO2, SO2, Ozone, PM2.5 and PM10) across the conterminous
             United States for user-defined time ranges. It helps users to
             automatically retrieves pollutant data from the Environmental
             Protection Agencyâ€™s (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) API service.
             'PARGASITE' filters the data by exceptional event (e.g., wildfire)
             status, performs spatial interpolations, and summarizes pollutant
             concentrations by geographic boundaries including state, county,
             and Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA). It also offers a 'Shiny'
             application for interactively visualization of pollutant levels and
             easily checking of air quality status for a given location over
             time relative to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
             (NAAQS).
