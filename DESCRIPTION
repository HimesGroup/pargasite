Description: This package offers tools to estimate and visualize levels of major
             pollutants (CO, NO2, SO2, Ozone, PM2.5 and PM10) across the
             conterminous United States for user-defined time ranges. It
             provides functions to retrieve pollutant data from the
             Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS)
             API service for interactive visualization through a 'Shiny'
             application, allowing users to explore pollutant levels for a given
             location over time relative to the National Ambient Air Quality
             Standards (NAAQS).
