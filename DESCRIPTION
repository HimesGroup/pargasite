Description: Pollution-Associated Risk Geospatial Analysis SITE (PARGASITE)
             offers tools to estimate and visualize major pollutant levels (CO,
             NO2, SO2, Ozone, PM2.5 and PM10) covering the conterminous United
             States at user-defined time ranges. It help users to automatically
             retrieves pollutant data via the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s
             (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) API service, filters the data by
             exceptional event (e.g., wildfire) status, performs spatial
             interpolations, and summarizes pollutant concentrations by
             geographic boundaries including State, County, and Core-Based
             Statistical Area (CBSA). It also offers a Shiny application to
             interactively visualize pollutant levels and to easily check the
             air quality status of a given location over time relative to the
             level of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
