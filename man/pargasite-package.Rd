\title{pargasite: Pollution-Associated Risk Geospatial Analysis}
\description{
Pollution-Associated Risk Geospatial Analysis STIE (PARGASITE) offers tools to estimate and visualize major pollutant levels (CO, NO2, SO2, Ozone, PM2.5 and PM10) covering the conterminous United States at user-defined time ranges. It help users to automatically retrieves pollutant data via the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) API service, filters the data by exceptional event (e.g., wildfire) status, performs spatial interpolations, and summarizes pollutant concentrations by geographic boundaries including State, County, and Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA). It also offers a Shiny application to interactively visualize pollutant levels and to easily check the air quality status of a given location over time relative to the level of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
