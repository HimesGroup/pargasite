Description: This package provides raster layers from which pollution estimates 
  can be extracted for latitude longitude coordinates within the contiguous United 
  States at a 10km x 10km resolution. The recent modified version of the package also allows 
  the user to download the pollutant data at the county, MMSA, census tract and zipcode level.
  Data is based on publicly available, pre-generated files from the United States Environmental 
  Protection Agency (EPA) for years 1997 to 2021.
  Estimates were calculated by taking the inverse distance-weighted average of the given pollutant 
  from the 5 nearest EPA monitoring sites. Annual estimates from annual files and monthly 
  estimates from daily files. See ../data_generation to learn how rasters were generated.
