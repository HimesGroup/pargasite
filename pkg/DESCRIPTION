Description: This package provides raster layers from which pollution estimates 
  can be extracted for latitude longitude coordinates within the contiguous United 
  States at a 10km x 10km resolution. Data is based on publicly available, pre-generated 
  files from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for years 2005 to 2017. 
  Estimates were calculated by taking the inverse distance-weighted average of the given pollutant 
  from the 5 nearest EPA monitoring sites. Annual estimates from annual files and monthly 
  estimates from daily files.
